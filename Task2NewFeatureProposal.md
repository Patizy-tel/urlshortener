Proposed Feature:



Scheduled Link Expiration



Feature Description:


The Scheduled Link Expiration feature allows users to set an expiration date and time for shortened URLs. Once the specified time is reached, the shortened URL automatically expires and becomes unusable, redirecting users to a designated page informing them that the link has expired.

############################################################################################################

Technical Implementation:



Database Schema Update:




Add a new field to the URL documents in MongoDB to store the expiration date and time for each shortened URL.



Backend Implementation:



Integrate a scheduled task or cron job in the NestJS application to periodically check and invalidate expired URLs based on their expiration timestamps.


API Endpoints:



Create API endpoints to allow users to set or update the expiration date for shortened URLs.



User Interface Enhancement:

Update the user interface to display the expiration date for each shortened URL and provide options for users to set or modify the expiration date.



###################################################################################################################################################


User Experience Enhancement:



Setting Expiration Date:



Users can set an expiration date and time while creating or editing shortened URLs, providing more control over the lifespan of the links.



Visual Indication:



Display a visual indicator (e.g., countdown timer) next to each shortened URL showing the time remaining before expiration.



Notification:



Notify users through email or in-app notifications when a shortened URL is nearing its expiration, giving them the option to extend the expiration date if needed.


#############################################################################################################################################
Integration with Existing System:




Database Integration:



Update the MongoDB data model to include the expiration date field for each shortened URL.



Backend Logic:

Implement logic in the NestJS application to handle the scheduled expiration of URLs based on the expiration timestamps stored in the database.



API Endpoints:

Introduce new API endpoints to manage the expiration dates of shortened URLs, allowing users to set, update, or query expiration information.

Anticipated Impact:



Enhanced User Control:



Users can now manage the lifespan of shared URLs, providing improved control over the visibility and accessibility of their shared content.




Improved Security:



Automatically expiring URLs can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information shared via shortened links, enhancing overall security.



User Engagement:



The Scheduled Link Expiration feature adds a new dimension to user interaction with the service by offering the ability to set time-limited sharing options, potentially increasing user engagement and utilization of the service.
