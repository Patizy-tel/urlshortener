39-49: Ensure proper type handling for query parameters in getPaginatedResults.

Consider validating the page and pageSize parameters to ensure they are positive integers before processing. This can prevent potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior due to invalid input.

src/services/shortner/shortner.services.ts (1)
68-84: Review pagination logic and error handling in getallShortUrlsPaginated.

Ensure that the pagination logic correctly handles cases where page or pageSize might lead to a negative skip value. Additionally, consider enhancing the error handling to provide more specific error messages related to pagination issues.
