analysing the current architecture of the url shortening service  2  potential bottle necks  found  that may face perfomance issues

*potential  bottlenecks*:

1: *Concurrency and request handling*:current seip  in the nestjs  may  struggle to handle concurrent requests effficiently leading to  bottlenexks in incoming traffic

2:*database  perfomance*:with the current setup  an increased  read and write operations especially handling  high volumnes  request and analytics tracking may pose to be a problem  in terms of efficiency and performance



*proposed solution*:

1:Database Scaling:


        Vertical Scaling: increase the database servers resources (cpu ,ram ,storage) to  handle the increased workload temporarilt( this one has limitations also in terms on scalability)


        Horizontal scaling:shard the mongo database to distribute the data across multiple  servers based on the shard key: Implement  replica sets to improve scalability and fault tolerance



2:Caching:


        introduce caching mechanism using redis or memchached to cache frequently access data , this will reduce the load on the database and improve  response time



3:Load Balancing:


         implement a load  balancer to distribute incoming traffic evenly acres  muiltple instances of  the application, this also helps in horizontal scalling and improving application performance availability and responsiveness



4:Asynchronous Processing:

         utilize message queue ( rabbitmq, or Kafka) and  a background job processing thi handle tasks asynchronously , for non-time sensitive  operations like analytic process , offload work toa background workers to free up the main application

5: Auto-scaling:



        Configure auto-scaling policies on the cloud provider to automatically add or remove instances based on metrics like CPU utilization or request count. This dynamic scaling approach ensures resources adapt to traffic spikes.



6: Monitoring and Alerts:

        Set up comprehensive monitoring using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch to track application performance, database metrics, and overall system health. Configure alerts to notify administrators of any anomalies or performance issues



7: Optimize Code and Queries:



            Review and optimize code logic, database queries, and indexing strategies to improve efficiency and reduce response times. Consider refactoring code to be more performant and scalable



Implementation of Solutions:

Database Scaling:


Scale MongoDB by adding more nodes to the cluster and configuring sharding for horizontal scaling.
Regularly monitor database performance and query execution times to identify any bottlenecks.



Caching:



Integrate a caching layer (e.g., Redis) into the application to store frequently accessed data and reduce database load.


Load Balancing:



Configure a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, AWS ELB) to distribute incoming traffic to multiple instances of the NestJS application.



Asynchronous Processing:



Implement message queues and background processing systems to handle tasks asynchronously and offload heavy operations from the main application.



Auto-scaling:



Set up auto-scaling policies based on predefined thresholds for CPU utilization, memory usage, or request counts to automatically adjust the number of application instances.



Monitoring and Alerts:



Continuously monitor system metrics and application performance using monitoring tools. Set up alerts to notify administrators of any issues that require attention.




Optimize Code and Queries:



Conduct regular code reviews and performance optimizations to ensure the system remains efficient under increased load.
